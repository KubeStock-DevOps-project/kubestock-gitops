# JWT validation - CONSOLIDATED AT GATEWAY LEVEL
# =============================================================================
# NOTE: JWT validation is handled at the Istio ingress gateway level
# (see gateway-jwt-guard.yaml). This file is kept for reference but
# the gateway-level validation is sufficient.
#
# The gateway:
# 1. Validates JWT signature using Asgardeo's JWKS endpoint
# 2. Validates issuer and audience claims
# 3. Sets requestPrincipal for AuthorizationPolicy to use
# 4. Forwards original token to services
#
# Sidecar-level RequestAuthentication is NOT needed because:
# - Gateway already verified the JWT signature
# - AuthorizationPolicy uses requestPrincipal set by gateway
# - Token is forwarded to services via forwardOriginalToken: true
